# Feature: Pagination on Organizations
#   As a UC Berkeley student,
#   I want to be able to view 3 organizations at a time once I take the quiz,
#   So that I am not overwhelmed by all the organizations at once.

# Scenario: 
#   Given I am logged in
#   And I am on "home page"
#   Then I should see the organizations I am matched with appear 3 at a time
